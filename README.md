# Jupiter_SPH
Final project for Ph235 at The Cooper Union, by Sai Chikine and Alex Rybchuk.

This project uses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in order to model two phenomena.

## 1) Planet Equilibrium
A collection of particles are initialized in a circle (2d) or a sphere (3d) with a normal distribution. The position of the particles evolves over time due to pressure forces and gravity forces, until they reach equilibrium.

## 2) Planetary Collision
Two identical equilibrium planets are initialized and are then collided with one another.
