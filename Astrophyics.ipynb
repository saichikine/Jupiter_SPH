    "# Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Sai Chikine and I would like to tackle the problem of modeling a supernova for our Ph235 Final Project. Both the inspiration and the approach for addressing the problem come from the textbook <u>Numerical Methods in Astrophysics: An Introduction</u>, which can be found in Chapter 6 [here](http://iate.oac.uncor.edu/~manuel/astrofisica_numerica/Numerical%20Methods%20in%20Astrophysics.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "The project comes from Chpater 6 of the aforementioned textbook. The textbook describes that modeling the supernova can be neatly split into three subsections. In the first part, the evolution of a star is modeled, begining  at the main sequence, and ending when a large iron core of radius $3.9 x 10^{12}cm$ appears. In the second phase, the iron core collapses to form a neutron star. The third phase follows the shock wave beyond the radius of the initial star. For our final project, we plan to model the first two stages of this process, each tackling one subsection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before Chapter 6, the textbook covers different topics like Smoother paricle Hydrodynamics and Stellar Evolution which are necessary for this project. We would also split up the reading as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "#### Stellar Evolution\n",
    "In order to model the life of an average star, the authors of the textbook assume hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry. Three equilibrium equations are used: hydrostatic equilibrium, mass conservation, and energy conservation. These equations are first order differential. A fourth order differential equation describing energy transport is also used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neutron Star\n",
    "In order to model the collapse to a neutron star, grid-based methods will be used. These methods are described in the early part of Chapter 6.\n",

    "# TEXTBOOK NOTES\n",
    "## N-Body Problem\n",
    "* (p73) 5 approaches, the first two of which are RK4 and Bulirsch-Stoer\n",
    "* The next few pages goes into detail tracking the error of the calculation as it runs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Small N-Body Problem\n",
    "* Then the book goes into the situation where you have one massive particle orbited by several smaller particles\n",
    "    * Extrasolar planets - With more data on them comes more questions - Are there configurations that are consistent with the data and yet dynaically unstable? Are there alternate configurations of planets which also provide good fits to data?\n",
    "* Symplectic algorithm - Breaks motion into Keplerian (analytical) part and non-Keplerian part\n",
    "    * Works well for planetary systems where planets have little interaction between one another. Breaks down fast when planetary orbits approach one another. \n",
    "    * Runs up to 10 times fast than BS method\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Large N-Body Problem\n",
    "* Two problems - Tons of interplanetary interactions means lots of calculations O(N^2), and multiple time scales\n",
    "* Can use Tree methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\n",
    "* Major hydrodynamical problems in astrophysics attacked with two approaches\n",
    "    * 1) Grid-based methods (Ch 2, Ch 6)\n",
    "    * 2) Smoother Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) - A Lagrangrian method related to N-body physics\n",
    "* Big difference between SPH and N-Body - Pressure exists for gases\n",
    "* Euler methods - Look at a fixed space and track properties there\n",
    "    * Generally work well for symmetric problems or problems where you only need to simulate part of a lager system\n",
    "* Lagrange methods - Follow a fixed particle\n",
    "#### Colliding Planets: An SPH Test Problem\n",
    "* Need a resonable model for the equilibrium structure of a giant planet (Ideal Gas Law or Polytrope)\n",
    "* Figure 4.1 shows the results of a rudimentary simulation\n",
    "* Can make a whole bunch of improvements to the rudimentary simulation, each of which is its own subsection in Chapter 4\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "* SPH Benefits\n",
    "    * Code is self-adaptive. No need to redefine grid every problem\n",
    "    * If there are extensive empty regions, SPH is more efficient\n",
    "    * SPH follows N-body problem, which comes with a ton of literature\n",
    "    * Better in problems with free boundaries and without symmetries\n",
    "* SPH Failures\n",
    "    * Has more dificulties dealing with shocks\n",
    "    * Less developed in treating effects of radiation transfer\n",
    "    * Calculation of numerical second spacial derivatives can be a problem\n",
    "    * Worse at treating problems with fixed boundaries\n",
    "    * If you introduce variable smoothing lengths, energy might not be conserved. There are ways to deal with this though.\n",
    "    * IC's are more complicated\n",
    "* Chapter ends with simulation of origin of the moon\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stellar Evolution\n",
    "* Main-sequence evolution is driven by conversion of hyrogen to helium as a result of nuclear reactions\n",
    "* Post-main-sequence phase driven by a combination of nuclear transformations as well as contraction/expansion of various layers of stars\n",
    "* Goal: Obtain evolutionary history given its initial mass and chemical composition\n",
    "* Use: Hydrostatic equation (5.3), Conservation of mass (5.4), Conservation of energy (5.8), Energy transport description (Sec 5.2)\n",
    "#### Energy Transfer - Radiative, Convective, and Conductive\n",
    "#### Change in Chemical Composition\n",
    "* Look at the change in mass fraction of each element\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grid-Based Hydrodynamics\n",
    "* Grid-based methods are better at dealing with shocks\n"
